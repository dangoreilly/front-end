                <p>The NEBB Knights will hold introductory training sessions and preliminary trials for 
                    U16/18 players on <strong>Sunday, 4th December</strong> in <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cuchulainn's+(Cavan)+GAA+Club/@53.8089088,-6.9385612,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x486755f670ba12e1:0x675091ac03c0e3b0!8m2!3d53.8089388!4d-6.9387359">Mullagh Sports Hall</a></strong></p>
                <p>The Knights teams are the regional teams of the North East Area Board and are composed 
                    of players from clubs throughout Cavan, Meath, Monaghan, Louth and Streete. The coaches/managers 
                    are all volunteers from the North East clubs. For a number of years prior to the 
                    onset of the Covid pandemic in Spring 2020 the U16 and U18 teams have been offering 
                    players and coaches the opportunity to experience basketball at an international 
                    European level, and to grow and develop their own skills in the process as well as 
                    enjoying the social aspect of getting to know others throughout the region. The teams 
                    are open to all eligible North East players.</p>
                <p>Hopefully next summer the teams will be travelling again to the Eurobasket tournament 
                    in Lloret de Mar, Spain in the first week in July. </p>

                <p><strong>COACHES/MANAGERS</strong></p>
                <p>The number of teams selected will depend on having enough coaches/managers prepared to
